# Frontend Mentor - Password generator app

![Design preview for the Password generator app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

In this challenge by Frontend Mentor. I made a password generator app.

### A user will generate a password based on these criterias

. To include Uppercase letters
. To include Lowercase letters
. To include Numbers
. To include Symbols
. And the length of that password

The app will generate the password and tell the user whether the password is "Too weak", "Weak", "Medium" and "Strong".

A user will have the option to generate another password or copy the password generated based on the user's preference.

**Here are pre-requisites to do this challenge, strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
